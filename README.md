## 🚀 Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates a complete ML pipeline:

1. Data Loading
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Feature Scaling / Encoding
6. Model Training
7. Model Evaluation
8. Final Prediction

The goal is to build a robust regression model that predicts house prices accurately.
